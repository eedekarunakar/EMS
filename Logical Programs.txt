Question 5:

Question
Write a Java program where the user has to guess a randomly generated number within a given range (e.g., 1 to 100). The user has a limited number of attempts to guess the number correctly. After each guess, the program should provide feedback on whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct. If the user fails to guess the number within the allowed attempts, the program should reveal the correct number.

Input
The program should accept the user's guessed number as input.
The program should have a predefined number of attempts (e.g., 7 attempts).

import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.Random;

public class NumberGuessingGame {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        Random random = new Random();
        int numberToGuess = random.nextInt(100) + 1;
        int numberOfAttempts = 7;

        System.out.println("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!");
        System.out.println("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.");
        System.out.println("You have " + numberOfAttempts + " attempts to guess the number.");

        for (int i = 1; i <= numberOfAttempts; i++) {
            System.out.print("Attempt " + i + ": Enter your guess: ");
            int userGuess = scanner.nextInt();

            if (userGuess == numberToGuess) {
                System.out.println("Congratulations! You guessed the number in " + i + " attempts.");
                break;
            } else if (userGuess > numberToGuess) {
                System.out.println("Your guess is too high.");
            } else {
                System.out.println("Your guess is too low.");
            }

            if (i == numberOfAttempts) {
                System.out.println("Sorry! You've used all your attempts. The correct number was " + numberToGuess + ".");
            }
        }
    }
}

Output:
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!

Question 6:

Question
Write a Java program that challenges the user to guess the next number in a mathematical sequence. The sequence will follow a specific pattern (e.g., Fibonacci sequence, arithmetic progression, geometric progression, etc.). The program should generate the sequence, display it to the user (excluding the last number), and ask the user to guess the next number. The program will then check if the guess is correct and provide feedback.

Input
The program should generate a sequence based on a specific pattern.
The user will input their guess for the next number in the sequence.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class NumberSequenceChallenge {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        int[] sequence = generateArithmeticSequence(5, 3, 5); // start at 5, increment by 3, length 5
        
        // Display the sequence to the user (excluding the last number)
        System.out.print("Sequence: ");
        for (int i = 0; i < sequence.length - 1; i++) {
            System.out.print(sequence[i] + " ");
        }
        System.out.println("\nWhat is the next number in the sequence?");
        
        // User's guess
        int userGuess = scanner.nextInt();
        
        // Check if the user's guess is correct
        if (userGuess == sequence[sequence.length - 1]) {
            System.out.println("Correct! The next number is " + userGuess + ".");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Incorrect. The correct number was " + sequence[sequence.length - 1] + ".");
        }
    }

    // Method to generate an arithmetic sequence
    public static int[] generateArithmeticSequence(int start, int increment, int length) {
        int[] sequence = new int[length];
        sequence[0] = start;
        for (int i = 1; i < length; i++) {
            sequence[i] = sequence[i - 1] + increment;
        }
        return sequence;
    }

    // Method to generate a geometric sequence
    public static int[] generateGeometricSequence(int start, int ratio, int length) {
        int[] sequence = new int[length];
        sequence[0] = start;
        for (int i = 1; i < length; i++) {
            sequence[i] = sequence[i - 1] * ratio;
        }
        return sequence;
    }
    
    // Method to generate a Fibonacci sequence
    public static int[] generateFibonacciSequence(int length) {
        int[] sequence = new int[length];
        sequence[0] = 0;
        sequence[1] = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i < length; i++) {
            sequence[i] = sequence[i - 1] + sequence[i - 2];
        }
        return sequence;
    }
}

Question 8:

Question
Write a Java program to solve a maze represented as a 2D array. The maze has 0 for open paths and 1 for walls. You need to find a path from the top-left corner of the maze (start) to the bottom-right corner (end). The program should print the path if it exists or indicate that there is no path.

Input
A 2D integer array representing the maze. 0 represents an open path and 1 represents a wall.
The start position is (0, 0), and the goal position is (maze.length - 1, maze[0].length - 1).

import java.util.*;

public class MazeSolver {
    private static final int[] ROW = { -1, 1, 0, 0 };

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] maze = {
            {0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0},
            {0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0},
            {0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1},
            {1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1},

        }
        
        if (!isValid(maze, x, y, visited)) {
            return false;
        }
        
        visited[x][y] = true;
        path.add(new int[]{x, y});
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            int newX = x + ROW[i];
            int newY = y + COL[i];
            
            if (dfs(maze, newX, newY, goalX, goalY, visited, path)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        
        path.remove(path.size() - 1); // Backtrack
        return false;
    }
    
    // Check if the cell is within bounds and not yet visited
    private boolean isValid(int[][] maze, int x, int y, boolean[][] visited) {
        return x >= 0 && x < maze.length && y >= 0 && y < maze[0].length 
                && maze[x][y] == 0 && !visited[x][y];
    }
}

Output:
Path found:
